# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

Introducing the Weather Dashboard: Our objective is to provide users with up-to-date weather information, including today's current weather data and a five-day forecast. Additionally, the dashboard maintains a history of past search results, enabling users to revisit and view the weather data for previously searched cities.

To utilize the dashboard, simply enter the name of a city in the search box and click the spyglass icon. As you search, the city will be added to a list for convenient future selection and viewing.
